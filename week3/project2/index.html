      LANGLEY, VA - A report realsed Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreads
      of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
    </p>
    <p class="line-height">
      According to the report, sections of the documents - "almost invariably the most crucial passages" - are marred by an indelible black ink
      that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
